### 1、Machine learning assisted co-precipitation synthesis
  * Theoretical calculation of reaction parameters
  Ni, Co, and Mn ion concentrations were calculated with pH under different reaction conditions.
  * A particle growth modeling procedure
  Can quickly obtain crystal nucleation and growth rates and predict growth trends.
  * Digitally model
    All digitally modeling images
    The machine learning model, the PMD-LSTM program, and the augmented data.
### 2、Literature research and analysis using Python<br>
  *In progress.
