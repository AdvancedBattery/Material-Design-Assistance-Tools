## Description：<br>
### 1、Machine learning assisted co-precipitation synthesis
  * Theoretical calculation program<br>
  Theoretical calculation of reaction parameters:Ni, Co, and Mn ion concentrations were calculated with pH under different reaction conditions. <br>
  * A particle growth modeling procedure<br>
  Can quickly obtain crystal nucleation and growth rates and predict growth trends.
  * Digitally model<br>
    All digitally modeling images. <br>
    The machine learning model, the PMD-LSTM program, and the augmented data.
### 2、Literature research and analysis using Python<br>
  *In progress.
